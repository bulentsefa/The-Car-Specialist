In today's world, many people buy a car, refurbish their cars or sell their cars. During these times of purchase and sale, people may be confused in setting prices. There are many factors that affect the selling price of the car. In addition, many parameters such as model, miilage, fuel consumption etc. are effective in determining the price. Due to the existence of many factors and parameters, it is not easy to predict how much they will affect the sales price. At this very confusing point, we want to help people estimate their car sales prices. At the beginning of our study, we conducted a literature review in order to select the right parameters and correct factors and give them appropriate rates. We analyzed the parameters used by major used car sales sites such as carmax and edmunds.
